# DiceGame

This is an old game I worked on with basic JS, HTML, and CSS. The goal of the game is to reach 100 points before the other player.
The catch is that if you roll the number one on your dice roll, you will lose all the points you have accumulated for that turn and your turn ends.
So you must balance the risk/reward and choose when to press the hold button to end your turn, and save your score.
